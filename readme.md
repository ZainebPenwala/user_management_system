 - antarctica_project: this folder contains the entire project's configurations
 - user_auth: this folder contains the core business logic of the registration, login, logout,       UserList and the authentication flows
 - user_auth/templates: contains the HTML files
 - user_auth/static: contains the CSS and JavaScript files along with images used in the application

 - # Authentication System
     - The authentication mechanism is implemented using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
     - JWT provides a means of transmitting information from the client to the server in a stateless, secure way. On the server, JWTs are generated by signing user information via a secret key, which are then securely stored on the client.
     - The secret key is stored in `user_auth/views.py` file.
     - The JWT token was generated using the admin email address `kumail@antarcticaglobal.com` and the resultant auth token was `eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJpYXQiOjE2MDI3Nzk1MTYsInN1YiI6Imt1bWFpbEBhbnRhcmN0aWNhZ2xvYmFsLmNvbSJ9.j5mzdawtPAzOiJjwicwYf9Jw0Btk60fCbB3ZIjRrB-0`
     - This JWT token has no expiry and the admin is supposed to enter this token in order to access the UserList dashboard.
